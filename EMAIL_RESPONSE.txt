Subject: Re: PeerIslands Coding Assignment Submission - Codebase Analysis Tool

Dear PeerIslands Team,

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this interesting coding assignment. I have completed the codebase analysis tool and am excited to share my solution with you.

## 📦 Submission Details

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/abhijita2017/PeerIslands-Codebase-Analyzer

**Key Deliverables:**
1. ✅ Complete Python-based codebase analysis tool using LLM
2. ✅ Analysis results in structured JSON format (output/analysis_results_20251113_120125.json)
3. ✅ Brief summary of findings (output/analysis_summary_20251113_120125.txt)
4. ✅ Comprehensive documentation (README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, SUBMISSION.md)
5. ✅ Production-ready source code with modular architecture

## 🎯 What I Built

I developed a sophisticated tool that analyzes GitHub repositories using Large Language Models to extract structured insights including:
- Project overview and architecture patterns
- All classes with method signatures and descriptions
- Code complexity metrics using cyclomatic complexity
- Dependency relationships and design patterns

**Analyzed Repository:** SakilaProject (https://github.com/janjakovacevic/SakilaProject)
- 46 files analyzed
- 42 classes identified with complete method signatures
- Architecture: MVC with Spring Framework
- Full results available in the repository

## 💡 Key Highlights

**Cost-Effective Solution:**
I implemented support for GitHub Models API, which is **100% FREE** for GitHub Copilot users. This makes the tool accessible to anyone without requiring paid API subscriptions.

**Technical Excellence:**
- Modular, maintainable architecture following SOLID principles
- Smart code chunking that respects token limits
- Multi-provider LLM support (GitHub Models, OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Well-documented with setup instructions

**Results:**
- Successfully extracted all classes, methods, and relationships
- Generated structured JSON output as requested
- Completed analysis in ~5 minutes with zero cost
- Production-ready code with proper testing utilities
